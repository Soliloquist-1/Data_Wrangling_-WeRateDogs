    "2. A tweet image prediction file, called \"image_predictions.csv\", that predicts of what breed each dog is with different confidence levels according to a neural network.\n",
    "3. A file called \"tweet_json.txt\" that contains retweet count and favorite count of each tweet as a supplement."

    "### 3. Assessing\n",
    "After gathring and reading in data from the three files, I applied visual assessment and physical assessment on each dataframe respectively and created a summary of issues that include:\n",

    "**Quality Issues**: mainly wrong data types, unnecessary columns, missing values, outliers of ratings, unclear column names. These issues are invalid, inconsistent or inaccurate values that might potentially skew later analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "To be more specific, I removed unnecessary columns, converted data types, deleted rows of retweets, fix suspicious denominator values, convert wrong name values including like \"such\", \"an\", and \"the\", convert values in dog_name column to capitalized format, combined \"doggo\", \"puppo\", \"pupper\" & \"floofer\" columns and created a new column named \"dog_type\".
