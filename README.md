# Data_Wrangling_WeRateDogs

This report is intended to show my process and efforts of data gather, assessing and wrangling of
the Twitter #WeRateDogs archive.

I made use of three datasets:

1. Enhanced Twitter Archive, which contains basic tweet data for all 5000+ of their tweets.
2. Additional Data via the Twitter API
3. Image Predictions File, every image in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive through a neural network that can classify breeds of dogs



My data wrangling consists of:
1. Gathering data
2. Assessing data
3. Cleaning data
4. Storing, analyzing, and visualizing the wrangled data
5. Reporting on 1) my data wrangling efforts and 2) my data analyses and visualizations
